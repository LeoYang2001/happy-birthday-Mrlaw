    "message": "Mr. Law,\nFate is an interesting thing. About a year ago, Dashu was probably just one of many restaurants you’d visited, but you chose to stay.\nAnd I’m really glad you did.\n\nMrs. Law once told me you never liked to drink anywhere else, and that really stayed with me. It made me smile, but more than that, it made me feel thankful. Thankful that Dashu isn’t just a restaurant to you, it’s something more.\nYou come so often that I’ve grown used to your presence. These days, whenever I visit my mom, it feels almost strange not seeing you. You’ve become part of the place… and part of us.\n\nThank you, Mr. Law.\nYou remind me how beautiful and pure people can be. I don’t even remember when it happened exactly, but somewhere along the way, you stopped being “just a regular.”\nTo me, to my mom, to Yi, you’ve become family. A kind, caring, and very special one.",
  "message_transalted": "Mr. Law: \n緣分真的是很奇妙。一年前，Dashu 對您來說可能只是眾多餐廳中的其中一家, 但您選擇了留下來。\n我真的很開心您做了這個選擇。\n\nMrs. Law曾經對我說，您從不喜歡在其他地方喝東西, 這句話我一直記在心裡。聽到時我笑了，但更多的是感動。感動的不只是您喜歡 Dashu，而是 Dashu 在您心中，已經不僅僅是一家餐廳了。\n\n您來得那麼頻繁，我已經習慣見到您。如今每次我回去看媽媽，如果沒看到您，反而覺得哪裡怪怪的。您早已成為那個地方的一部分……也成為了我們生活中的一部分。\n\n謝謝您，Mr. Law。\n您讓我看到人性可以是如此真誠與純粹。我甚至不記得是哪一天開始, 但在某個時刻之後，您已經不再只是\"熟客\"。\n\n對我、對我媽媽、對Yi來說, 您早就是我們的家人，\n一位溫柔、體貼且特別的家人。"

    "message": "Mr. Law,\nI don’t think I’ve ever been liked this much, and I mean that in the best way possible.\n\nFrom the very beginning, when you introduced me to Renee and tried to set us up, to inviting me on your family trip to Toronto, you’ve gone above and beyond to make me feel welcome. You even introduced me to your managers as your son-in-law, something I still joke about, but deep down, it really meant a lot.\n\nIt feels miraculous when someone who’s not blood-related treats me like their own. I remember every gift you gave me. I remember every early morning coffee chat during the trip, I genuinely enjoyed and resonated with every story you shared. I also remember the Wing Chun classes you taught me, especially that one moment you almost accidentally hurt me and immediately apologized. You seemed genuinely worried, and I truly appreciated that.\n\nAs strong as I thought I was, you really touched my heart in that moment. The way you cared, it felt like a father would.\n\nAfter the Toronto trip, something changed for me. I stopped seeing you as just Renee’s dad. You started to feel like family. The kind of family I don’t want to see driving too long on a road trip. The kind that reminds me of my grandpa, whom I haven’t seen in three years. The kind I’ve quietly told myself, I want to take care of, now and in the future.\n\nOne day, I hope I can return even a piece of what you’ve given me. I want to take you on as many trips as you want, because you deserve every single one of them.",
    "message_transalted": "Mr. Law:\n我想我從來沒試過被一個人這樣喜歡, 而且我是帶著最真誠的感激說這句話。\n\n從一開始您介紹我認識 Renee、撮合我們，到邀請我參加您一家人的多倫多之旅，您一直用各種方式讓我感受到被歡迎。甚至還向您的經理們介紹我為您未來的女婿, 雖然我常拿來開玩笑，但其實我心裡非常感動。\n\n能被一位沒有血緣關係的人這樣看待，真的很不可思議。我記得您送我的每一份禮物，也記得我們每一次清晨的咖啡對話, 那些聊天內容，我至今仍印象深刻。我也記得您教我詠春的每一課, 尤其是有一次您差點不小心傷到我時，那句真誠的道歉，讓我感受到您的在乎。\n\n那一刻，我才知道，原來自己看起來再怎麼堅強，也會因為被在意而感動。那種關心，就像父親對孩子的關心。\n\n多倫多之後，我對您的看法改變了。我不再只把您當成 Renee 的爸爸。您開始讓我覺得，像家人一樣。那種家人，是我不願意看著他長途開車的家人；是我三年沒見、深深思念的外公那種家人；是我在心裡悄悄下定決心想照顧的那種人。\n\n有一天，我希望我能回報您給我的一切，哪怕只有一小部分。我想帶您去很多很多旅行, 因為您值得每一段旅程。"

   "message": "Mr. Law,\nDuring the trip, you opened up to me about your regrets, how you didn’t spend enough time with Renee when she was younger because of work. You told me about the guilt you carry over her surgery at 16, and I could see in your eyes just how much it still weighs on you.\nIt was one of the most heartfelt conversations I’ve ever had.\n\nI understand why you’re worried. She’s your everything. And you once said you won’t be able to look after her for many more years. That really hit me. I felt your love, not in words, but in your worry.\n\nSo I want to give you my word: I will try my best to always keep her close. Even if we don’t end up together, I’ll still find a way to include her in my life, maybe as a friend, maybe as something more. But I’ll always look out for her, because she deserves to be cared for, and because I know how much she means to you.",
   "message_transalted": "Mr. Law:\n這次旅程中，您向我坦白了您內心的一些遺憾, 過去因為工作，沒能在 Renee 小時候多陪陪她。您也提到了她十六歲做手術的事，那份內疚到現在還藏在您心裡，我從您眼神裡看得出來。\n那是我人生中其中一次最真摯的對話。\n\n我明白您為什麼會那麼擔心。因為她是您最重視的人。您曾說過，您未必能再照顧她很多年, 那句話讓我很觸動。那不是單純的語言，而是一份深沉的父愛，透過憂慮表達出來。\n\n所以我想向您承諾：我會盡我所能，把她留在我生命中。就算最後我們無法成為情侶，我也會用其他方式與她保持聯繫, 也許是朋友，也許是更親密的關係。但無論如何，我都會照顧她，因為她值得被關心, 也因為我知道，她對您有多重要。"

     "message": "Mr. Law,\nOne of my favorite parts of the trip was sharing early mornings with you. After you realized I was always up early, we started texting each other the moment we woke up. That small tradition meant more than you probably know.\n\nYou told me you don’t usually eat breakfast, just coffee, half water, no sugar. And the reason behind that, that you just don’t like having breakfast alone, really stayed with me. It made me feel something quiet and deep. If I’m ever back in Huntsville, I’d love to have more mornings like those. Coffee together. No rush. Just company.\n\nAnd the road trip, from Atlanta to New York, was long, even for passengers who were sleeping. But I knew you cherished that time in the van with everyone. I could tell it was your way of soaking up every second. It was your minimal wish, and I’m so glad we made it happen.",
     "message_transalted": "Mr. Law:\n這次旅程中，我最喜歡的部分之一，就是每天早上和您一起開始的時光。您發現我總是早起之後，我們就開始每天一醒來就互傳訊息。這個小小的習慣，其實比您想像的還要珍貴。\n\n您曾說過，您平常不吃早餐, 只喝半水半咖啡，不加糖。而原因，是因為您不喜歡一個人吃早餐。這句話深深打動了我。那是一種安靜卻深刻的情感。如果我有機會再去 Huntsville，我真的很想再有這樣的早晨時光。有您的陪伴，不趕時間，只是單純地坐著喝咖啡。\n\n從亞特蘭大到紐約的長途車程，即使對乘客來說也不輕鬆。但我知道，您很珍惜和家人一起在七人車上的每一分鐘。我看得出來，這段時光對您來說，是一種最簡單但最真摯的願望。我真的很開心，我們一起完成了它。"

     "message": "Mr. Law,\nThank you again for inviting me on the Toronto trip, it turned out to be an unforgettable experience. I didn’t expect I’d feel so sad when it ended. But in those last two hours of driving back, listening to Beyond music with you, all the moments, big and small, came rushing in. I never thought I’d come to know your family so deeply… and I miss it. I miss the warmth, the laughter, the bond. It felt like I belonged. Like I was part of it.\n\nThank you for introducing me to Renee. She’s a truly special girl and an amazing daughter. I really admire the bond you share with her, the kind that’s filled with care and love, even when it’s quiet and unspoken. I’ve seen how much you want the best for her, and how thoughtful you are about not putting too much pressure on her. She’s lucky to have a father like you. And thank you for never forcing anything between us, for simply letting things unfold naturally.\n\nThank you also for all the stories you’ve shared. You always quote your mom with such pride, and I’ve learned a lot just from listening. Your journey, from Hong Kong to Canada to the U.S., from shipping to building a restaurant chain, it’s nothing short of legendary. And the way you tell it, with such humility and heart, continues to motivate me every day.\n\nAnd of course, thank you for teaching me Wing Chun. Even with a clumsy student like me, you were so patient, so encouraging. I’ll always remember how you made every lesson feel fun and inspiring.\n\nThank you, Mr. Law, for everything.",
  "message_transalted": "Mr. Law:\n謝謝您邀請我參加這趟多倫多之旅, 它成為了我難以忘懷的一段回憶。我從沒想過，旅程結束時我竟會那麼不捨。在最後兩小時返程的路上，聽著您放的 Beyond 音樂，過去的每一個畫面, 無論大事小事, 全都浮現眼前。我從沒想過，自己能這麼深入地走進您的家庭……我真的很想念那份溫暖、笑聲和連結。那是一種歸屬感，像是我本來就屬於那裡一樣。\n\n謝謝您介紹我認識 Renee。她是一個非常特別的女孩，也是一位令人敬佩的女兒。我很欣賞您和她之間的關係, 那是一種不張揚但深刻的愛。我看得出來，您多麼希望她過得好，同時又小心翼翼地不給她太多壓力。她真的很幸運，有您這樣的爸爸。也謝謝您從不強求我們的關係發展, 而是讓一切自然地發生。\n\n還有，謝謝您分享的每一個故事。您總是自豪地引用您媽媽的話，而我光是聽著，就已經學到很多。從香港到加拿大再到美國，從航運業到建立自己的餐飲王國, 這段歷程本身就像一個傳奇。但您講起來卻總是那麼謙遜、那麼真誠，這種態度一直激勵著我。\n\n當然，也謝謝您教我詠春。即使我是一個笨手笨腳的學生，您也一直很有耐心、很鼓勵我。每一堂課我都記得，因為您讓每次練習都變得有趣又充滿啟發。\n\n謝謝您，Mr. Law, 謝謝您給我的一切。"
